This is branched from rc-beta. 
rc-beta is brought in from newton.cs.purdue.edu machine. 
rc-beta is the first release version which fixed issues with subsampling bug. 
rc-beta and rc-alpha suffers from the same problem for mushrooms dataset, where
for subsampling/nonuniform sampling for 100 iterations, the cost function actually 
increases. This needs to be looked into. MATLAB version just works fine.
